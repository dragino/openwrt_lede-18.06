Description:  Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web using http
 and ftp, the two most widely used Internet protocols. It works
 non-interactively, so it will work in the background, after having
 logged off. The program supports recursive retrieval of web-authoring
 pages as well as ftp sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of
 archives and home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.
 This package is built with SSL support.
