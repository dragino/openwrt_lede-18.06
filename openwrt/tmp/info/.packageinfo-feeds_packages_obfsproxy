Description: obfsproxy is a tool that attempts to circumvent censorship, by
transforming the Tor traffic between the client and the bridge. This
way, censors, who usually monitor traffic between the client and the
bridge, will see innocent-looking transformed traffic instead of the
actual Tor traffic.
